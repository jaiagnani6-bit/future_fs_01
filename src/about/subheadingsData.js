           As a Full Stack Developer Intern at Developers Arena, I was responsible for the end-to-end development of several key projects within a self-paced, results-driven structure. 
           I architected and implemented features for both the client and server side, leveraging React.js for a modern, component-driven frontend and Node.js/Express for efficient backend services and API design. 
           This role significantly sharpened my skills in taking ownership of the full stack and managing complex, independent development tasks.
